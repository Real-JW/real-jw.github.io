    My research interests are focused on <span style="color:#3e75ff;">hardware security</span> and <span style="color:#3e75ff;">computer architecture</span>.
    Specifically, I am passionate about <span style="color:#3e75ff;">zero-knowledge proofs</span>, <span style="color:#3e75ff;">hardware accelerators</span>,
    and their intersections.<br><br>
