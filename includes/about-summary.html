    Hi there! Welcome to Jiawen's homepage.<br><br>
    I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, advised by Prof. Jeyavijayan (JV) Rajendran. I began my doctoral studies in Fall 2023.<br><br>
    My research interests are focused on <span class="highlight-text">hardware security</span> and <span class="highlight-text">computer architecture</span>. Specifically, I am passionate about <span class="highlight-text">zero-knowledge proofs</span>, <span class="highlight-text">hardware accelerators</span>,
    and their intersections.<br><br>
